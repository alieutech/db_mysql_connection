# Week 5: Databases and Web Applications - Bridging the Gap 

Great work last week! You've mastered data manipulation in your Expense Tracker. This week, we'll delve into the exciting connection between databases and web applications, even though we won't be coding the actual connection yet.

## Understanding the Connection:

Imagine you're browsing a social media platform. When you see posts from your friends, a web application interacts with a database in the background, retrieving relevant data (posts, comments, etc.). This magic happens through a powerful connection, but how?

## Exploring Database Options:

There's a range of database server options available, each with its strengths:

MySQL: A widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its flexibility and ease of use.

PostgreSQL: Another powerful open-source RDBMS offering advanced features like object-relational capabilities.

Microsoft SQL Server: A robust commercial RDBMS solution from Microsoft, often used in enterprise environments.

Oracle Database: A high-performance commercial RDBMS known for its scalability and security features.

Node.js: While not strictly a database server, Node.js is a popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment often used for building web applications. Node.js can interact with various databases using libraries and frameworks.

## Learning the Universal Language - SQL:

Regardless of the database server, SQL (Structured Query Language) acts as the common language for communication. It allows applications to interact with databases and perform various operations like:

Retrieving Data: SELECT statements fetch specific data from database tables.

Inserting Data: INSERT statements add new records to the database.

Updating Data: UPDATE statements modify existing data within a database.

Deleting Data: DELETE statements remove unwanted records from the database.

## Questions (2 hours):

1.1. Database Server Comparison:  
Create a table comparing the following database server options (focusing on its role as a web application environment): 
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle Database
* Node.js 

**Include details like (Tabulate):**

1. Type (Open-Source/Commercial)
2. Target Audience
3. Key Features
4. Ease of Use

## Bonus: Hands-on SQL Practice (Optional):
